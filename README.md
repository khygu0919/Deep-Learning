# Deep-Learning
practice for mini project about DL

this notebook file is about CNN classifier using trasfer learning.
you could use this notebook file in any of image classifying ploblem by change class number.
I hope it will help you... I upload this file because the codes in github didn't work well on my machine ;( 

if you want to download dog dataset: https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/dogImages.zip
if you want to download skin cancer dataset: https://github.com/udacity/dermatologist-ai

You sould create directory named 'saved_model' to save weight file while running the notebook file.

I got 89.2% test accuracy as dog breed classifier and 69% test accuracy as skin cancer classifier

if you have better opinion PLEASE tell me what you got... ;(
